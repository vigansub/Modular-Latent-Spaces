Welcome, this is the MATLAB code corresponding to "Modular Latent Spaces for Shape Correspondences"

The purpose of the below files are as follows:

latent_transfer.m - Puts together the embedding and de-embedding pipelines

latent_transfer_emb.m - Performs the embedding. To this effect, it builds a map from the set of descriptors to an intermediate embedding space. 
This embedding space can further be modified using a neural network, here it uses a plain diffusion map.

latent_transfer_deemb.m - Performs de-embedding back from the latent shape space back to the original space. Uses the fminunc built in MATLAB function.

buildAffinity.m - Builds affinity matrices for two shapes and their corresponding fc, fd representations and epsilon values given input descriptors of two shapes.

Any use of this code/modification of the same in any publication, patent or for any other research purposes, requires citing of the following paper:
